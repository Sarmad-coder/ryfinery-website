This is done through Tamarran's online website and mobile app that help people find and book different kinds of fitness and sport related facilities, activities and events.  Tamarran was born to solve two key problems:  1-	The sport enthusiasts currently go through a lot of hassles to access and book the suitable sport facility, activity or event as they must search, call, compare and book manually. These hassles take hours and sometimes days which make these people unhappy. 2-	On the other hand, Sport centers and different service providers within the sport field – such as gyms, sport academies, facility owners, personal trainers, studios, sport associations and sport event organizers – are struggling to manage their operations as almost everything is handled manually.    Tamarran believes that it has built an effective solution to solve the above-mentioned problems. Nowadays, it is currently focusing on enhancing its cloud-based system for the sport centers while on-boarding more centers on the platform to give the sport enthusiasts a big array of options for their sport needs and requirements. Solution: A) Tamarran App – For the sport enthusiasts: Book gyms, classes, personal trainers, cycling, horse riding, soccer, tennis, squash, basketball courts or water sports and more. Tamarran will soon introduce a feature to help you find partners to play with. B) Tamarran Owner App – For the service providers (Gym, Studio and Facility Owners): Run your sport center in a better way using Tamarran’s cloud-based app especially designed for service providers in the sports field.
