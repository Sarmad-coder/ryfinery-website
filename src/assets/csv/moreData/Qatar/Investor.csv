He attended the College of North Atlantic in Qatar and studied in Information systems. Growing up his father taught him important values and brought him up in a strict and disciplined environment. As an entrepreneur himself, he wanted Ahmed to continue his post-graduate studies and work in the family business.

Ahmed like most successful entrepreneurs decided to drop out of post-graduate school and focused on himself and what the real world had to offer. In 2016, with his ambition he started multiple businesses which eventually failed. Some of his earlier endeavors were an E-commerce platform and a third-party enterprise software support services business. In 2018, Ahmed co-founded 9to5.ai, a hiring-marketplace platform that helps connect quality job seekers with the best possible companies.

Ahmed is not just an entrepreneur but a real talent. And this talent is going to make him an innovator. His business career started with him practicing and failing on different avenues as early as possible that prepared him for what was ahead. He�s trained himself and looked for ways on how to do it and work really hard on becoming a great entrepreneur. He has a lot of passion and confidence because it made him grow stronger. He also had tips from professional mentors who prepared him well for his grueling journey.",Male,Co-Founder,,2,�,�,�,"82,060",�,�
