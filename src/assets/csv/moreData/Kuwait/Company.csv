https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kuwait-life-sciences-company,Kuwait Life Sciences Company,Health Care,Safat,Al Kuwayt,KLSC aims to be the Middle East�s premiere Life Sciences and Healthcare technology transfer and investment company,"216,457",�,Active,3-Mar-10,�,�,For Profit,"Kuwait Life Sciences (KLSC) was established in 2010, with a paid up capital of 15 million Kuwait Dinars (KD) which is equivalent to approximately $53 million US Dollars. KLSC is fully owned by National Technology Enterprises Company. National Technology Enterprises Company (NTEC) was incorporated in November of 2002, by the Kuwait Council of Ministers as a fully owned company by the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), the sovereign wealth fund of the State of Kuwait. Capitalized at 100 million Kuwait Dinars (KD) which is equivalent to approximately $350 million US Dollars, NTEC aims to play a vital role in servicing major stakeholders in Kuwait and the Middle East region with their technology requirements.

KLSC focuses on healthcare innovative concepts and demanded services which have a clear and unmet need in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. KLSC has been designed as an integrated healthcare company building unique projects and is considered one of the pioneer venture capitalist and private equity companies in the Middle East that invests globally and operates regionally seeking to advance healthcare services and systems within the region. KLSC supports both public and private sector stakeholders to access emerging technologies, establish unique projects and adapt best practices prevailing in today�s healthcare field. KLSC operates in healthcare investment, life sciences training, medical technology and pharmaceutical distribution.

Investment Strategy

KLSC follows a similar investment strategy according to its parent company, NTEC, focusing on the following three pillars �

1)	Incubation (Start Up) Projects � Local and Regional
2)	Venture Capital � International
3)	Private Equity � Regional and International

Incubation (Start Up) Projects � Local and Regional

KLSC invests in the project�s equity in partnership with the private sector entrepreneur or company and accommodates KLSC�s main strategic goal of technology transfer into Kuwait and the MENA region.
These projects are internally developed by KLSC and externally developed by the private sector. In both cases, KLSC usually favors the formation of a Joint Venture, partnering with technology providers, supporting projects that add value, meet a local or regional demand and are an internationally proven concept.

Examples already developed by KLSC include:
Life Sciences Academy � a knowledge transfer platform
Innomedics � a medical devices commercialization platform
Newbridges � a pharmaceutical commercialization platform

Venture Capital � International

KLSC invest in companies with products or services which solve existing customer problems with ground-breaking technologies and have the potential for above average, substantial growth.

Through many years of experience in direct venture capital investments and investing in world class venture capital funds, KLSC has developed a systematic process based on proprietary thought selection, comprehensive due diligence, and an active investment management.

The focus is pre-commercialization stage companies that are viable and financially attractive with clear exit strategies and a vision to expand into new markets such as Kuwait and the MENA region.

Examples of investments by KLSC include:
Quanta Fluid Solutions � a market leader in (home) hemodialysis solutions
Supersonic Imagine � a market leader in ultrasound imaging
Median Technologies � a market leader in oncology monitoring and imaging

Private Equity � Regional and International

KLSC also invests in more established companies with the purpose of reducing the time gap of certain in-demand technology introduction into the mass markets that follow the existing technology transfer platforms identified by KLSC for the Life Sciences Industry.

KLSC invests in the form of private equity in established life science and healthcare companies that have the potential of regional expansion, and a proven concept with sustainable business model.
Examples of investments by KLSC include:

Al Abdulhadi had a vision to create a company which would provide the local market with complete internet and IT solutions. In 1999 KuwaitNET was officially registered in the Ministry of Commerce & Industry; with a couple of additional owners who helped guide the new direction of the company by active involvement from the onset. Being a market leader in Hosting and Domains; coupled with the reputation as the most advanced technical company in Kuwait with regards to Unix and Linux; were the key perceptible success factors during this stage of the company's expansion.

During the early 2000s, as the internet became more popular and widely used worldwide, the Kuwaiti market also realized the potential in the online world and began to expand. Taking advantage of this rising tide of interest and the worldwide boom of the industry, KuwaitNET decided to partner with an international company, namely Red Hat. It was through this integration that we were able to reach for international standards of business, adding a new dimension to the work ethic and environment at KuwaitNET. With time we adopted examples of �best practices� from our growingly successful partner and continued to strive to emulate a global company in the local market, while keeping our entrepreneurial spirit.

We provide a zero-to-one product development & growth infrastructure for the tech startups in the region. As per our understanding, there are three factors lacking the most in the Middle East Startup Ecosystem when it comes to reaching the market with the right product:

1.  Lack of Lean Startup Development approach which leads to less financial waste and more productivity.
2. Tech manpower that has the know-how of building Minimum viable product fast in an agile manner.
3.  Growth marketing which leads to users acquisition & an agile feedback loop model whereby product keeps improving based on user's feedback.

We fulfill the gap in these three areas and do so with our lean-startup development model. We provide a full in-house spectrum of services from product validation to UI/UX designing, Website development, app development and Growth marketing via social media and SEO.

Our mission is to enrich the overall technological awareness and potential of the region.",-66750481,reach@o2onelabs.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/o2onelabs/,https://www.facebook.com/o2onelabs/,https://twitter.com/o2onelabs,https://o2onelabs.com/,�,�,�,�,�,�,Nov-50,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/o2one-labs,,,�,,",",Information Technology,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/information-technology-4fe3,Software,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/software-85b6,,,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,,,,,�,,,,

The platform is based on the concept of ""reward crowdfunding"", where Creators can reach their Project Goal through the generosity, support and interest of people in return for rewards. Jaribha facilitates and manages the process, while Creators keep full ownership of their ideas.

Jaribha.com's mission is to provide another alternative to start a project. We are Creators ourselves and we understand the pitfalls an early starter has. We aim to help and facilitate things for the Creator in as many ways as we can and will continue to add more services as we get feedback from all the users from the site.

Jaribha is a platform where someone can test the market before starting a project. A Creator may easily access the market by using the Internet and social media to reach many people and be able to get the amount needed to start a large or small project through the support of an online community. We exist to serve and help Creators accomplish their dreams. We aim to help others, and we feel good to know that we are making a difference.

What we aim to do is help those individuals that are looking for support to start their projects. We give the Creator an arena to promote their idea in an environment that is easy to browse and use. Make them test their projects without large expenses to see how the public reacts.

We believe this will not only affect the Creator directly but it will have an effect on the current mentality of the community; whether they take part virtually or in reality. Motivation of seeing others succeed and make their dreams a reality through a collaborative effort of society instills a sense of pride to the society and transcends that energy for future Creators.",96522441442,Support@jaribha.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/jaribha,https://www.facebook.com/Jaribha,https://twitter.com/jaribha,http://www.jaribha.com/,�,�,�,�,�,�,10-Jan,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/jaribha,,,�,,",,,,",Commerce and Shopping,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/commerce-and-shopping,Financial Services,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/financial-services-d7b6,Other,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/1718a583-5105-47e5-b3b0-16c2e3dca322,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,Finance,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/categories/finance,,,�,Sales and Marketing,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/sales-and-marketing,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/revenue_range/r_00000000,

The HR solution for incentives

You want more sales, but you need a more motivated team to make them. Here�s your solution: reward productive employees with incentives when they complete challenges!

Our app is here to redefine incentives by seamlessly integrating them into your company culture. We provide the tool that helps you achieve a more encouraging work environment, and you decide what challenges and incentives you want to assign.

No matter what industry category your company falls into, your team can benefit from extra motivation through incentives.

With Daring Agility, you can:
�	Transform routine tasks into fun challenges and link them to your chosen incentive.
�	Track employee performance, unlock their strong areas, and identify star performers.
�	Clearly communicate the challenge deadlines.
�	Boost overall employee morale and inspire healthy competition.
�	Encourage boosted productivity and potentially increased sales.

How it works:
�	Create a challenge, link it to an incentive, then assign it to players on a team.
�	Give each player feedback and rate their performance on a scale of +4 (Amazing Work!) to -1 (Unacceptable Work).
�	That�s it! The player with the highest rating is automatically the winner.

We�ve built the app to leverage proven psychological studies that show improved performance when linked to reward. Download the app now and redefine incentives at your company.",96594908448,Sami@daringagility.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/daring-agility/,,https://twitter.com/daringagility?s=21&t=KUxf4CyMD2PhzUWazLwobw,https://daringagility.com/,�,�,�,�,�,�,10-Jan,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/daring-agility,Sami Al-Essa,https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sami-al-essa,1,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_founders/daring-agility,",,",Administrative Services,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/administrative-services,Internet Services,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/internet-services,Software,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/software-85b6,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,,,�,,,,,,
