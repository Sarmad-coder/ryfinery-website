Investment Strategy

KLSC follows a similar investment strategy according to its parent company, NTEC, focusing on the following three pillars �

1)	Incubation (Start Up) Projects � Local and Regional
2)	Venture Capital � International
3)	Private Equity � Regional and International

Incubation (Start Up) Projects � Local and Regional

KLSC invests in the project�s equity in partnership with the private sector entrepreneur or company and accommodates KLSC�s main strategic goal of technology transfer into Kuwait and the MENA region.
These projects are internally developed by KLSC and externally developed by the private sector. In both cases, KLSC usually favors the formation of a Joint Venture, partnering with technology providers, supporting projects that add value, meet a local or regional demand and are an internationally proven concept.

Examples already developed by KLSC include:
Life Sciences Academy � a knowledge transfer platform
Innomedics � a medical devices commercialization platform
Newbridges � a pharmaceutical commercialization platform

Venture Capital � International

KLSC invest in companies with products or services which solve existing customer problems with ground-breaking technologies and have the potential for above average, substantial growth.

Through many years of experience in direct venture capital investments and investing in world class venture capital funds, KLSC has developed a systematic process based on proprietary thought selection, comprehensive due diligence, and an active investment management.

The focus is pre-commercialization stage companies that are viable and financially attractive with clear exit strategies and a vision to expand into new markets such as Kuwait and the MENA region.

Examples of investments by KLSC include:
Quanta Fluid Solutions � a market leader in (home) hemodialysis solutions
Supersonic Imagine � a market leader in ultrasound imaging
Median Technologies � a market leader in oncology monitoring and imaging

Private Equity � Regional and International

KLSC also invests in more established companies with the purpose of reducing the time gap of certain in-demand technology introduction into the mass markets that follow the existing technology transfer platforms identified by KLSC for the Life Sciences Industry.

KLSC invests in the form of private equity in established life science and healthcare companies that have the potential of regional expansion, and a proven concept with sustainable business model.
