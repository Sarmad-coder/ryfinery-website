My background allows me to engage with sales comprehensively, using energetic entrepreneurial approaches to exceed targets and drive profitability. A highly strategic professional, I combine skills in leadership and analysis to set an uncompromising standard for overall success. Currently, I manage large accounts for multinational clientele within the Middle East; I devote myself to the relationships I have with my prestigious regional clients, often traveling to Dubai on a monthly basis to have in person check ins on our work and our staff. I treat my coworkers and staff with the same level of care, too. My entrepreneurial edge and my personal approach allow me to optimize sales and communication.

While I currently work for Add Effect in Kuwait, I keep my independent entrepreneurship active. Add Effect tasked me with developing a booking software for its outdoor advertising business. As someone who has developed their own software over the years, I understand the importance of technological proficiency and adept advertising skills. I have stayed ahead of technological trends and understand that creating content on social media is a vital complement to more technical work. Due to my comprehensive approach, the software was a success. Never tired by my curiosity, I also developed a number of apps on my own over the past five years. No matter the scale of the project, I provide creative ideas that facilitate the sales process.

Working alongside others, I understand the need for a good rapport alongside tireless innovation. If people aren�t happy, the work will fall short. My effective communication skills ensure the successful management of the international market, and I strive to maintain strong, profitable relationships with leading agencies. I also maintain strong relationships with my colleagues at Add Effect. As Managing Director of Sales, I oversee the performance and enable the development of Account Executives and Managers through counseling, coaching, planning, delegation, monitoring and appraising my team.
