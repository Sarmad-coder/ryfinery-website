The platform comes in Arabic and English. More details about the gym management software can be found via: https://tamarran.com/en/business

The company is currently based in Bahrain and has recently started its expansion in KSA, UAE, and Kuwait with more than 200 venues in less than a year. Tamarran is raising funds to help in accessing GCC markets faster starting from KSA. Tamarran is striving to have the first mover advantage in the $4 billion sports and fitness market in this part of the world. The vision of this company is to become the MENA�s biggest sport community platform. A one-stop-shop for sports that connects the sport enthusiasts and service providers with each other and help them exercise, socialize and compete with each other using technology.

Tamarran is solving two important problems in this field. Firstly, it is very difficult for people to explore different sport options. It is also hard to find, compare and access the suitable sport facility, activity or personal trainer due to the scattered sources and lack of credible information. On the other side, the sport centers struggle a lot in running their businesses due to the absence of technological solutions as most of them either use manual systems, very old or very expensive solutions. Tamarran is solving these two problems by introducing one platform that connects everything together and enable people find and book a wide range of sport facilities, recreational activities and events in a fast manner while helping gym and studio owners better manage their businesses using a mobile app.",-36020149,ali.zayer@tamarran.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/tamarran/,https://www.facebook.com/tamarran.online,https://www.twitter.com/tamarran.online,https://www.tamarran.com/,�,�,�,Nov-50,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/tamarran,",",Ali Zayer,https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ali-zayer,2,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_founders/tamarran,",,",Apps,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/apps-2683,Software,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/software-85b6,Sports,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/sports-8f4d,,,"$222,885 ","$222,885 ",Seed,"$125,000 ",Seed,"$125,000 ",1-Nov-21,Seed,3,",,",1,3,�,�,,,,

Our mission to convert visionary ideas into fully functional platforms.  We are an innovation hub bridging the best capabilities offered by software houses, VCs and incubators.

EDX Labs builds, operates and sustains platforms to realize the next big original idea.

Why?
Beyond Silicon Valley and a handful of developed countries, there are few pure R&D hubs globally. Most societies remain reliant on innovation to be driven in these territories and accept their own role as consumers; worst still, existing ideas are regularly recycled and remodeled to fit the local economy. EDX Labs aims to disrupt this practice and rely on novel platforms that solve real-world problems.

EDX Labs has a successful track record of building leading technologies. Our first four SaaS ventures have gone through an in-house innovate and iterate process.

EDX Labs is currently the R&D engine behind companies such as CTM360, DMARC360, PENTEST360, and MG360.",00 973 77 360 360,info@edxlabs.com,https://www.linkedin.com/company/edx-labs/about/?viewAsMember=true,https://www.facebook.com/edxlabs/?view_public_for=370108757155176,,https://www.edxlabs.com/,�,�,�,10-Jan,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_employees_enum/edx-labs,,Mirza Asrar Baig,https://www.crunchbase.com/person/mirza-asrar-baig,1,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/people/field/organization.companies/num_founders/edx-labs,",,",Data and Analytics,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/data-and-analytics,Information Technology,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/information-technology-4fe3,Mobile,https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organization.companies/category_groups/mobile-ec09,,,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,�,,�,,

GVCA will organize conferences, industry-focused technology forums, training and workshops. In addition, GVCA will become a learning organization where members can share experiences and address issues of common interest.

Venture Capital (VC) is the equity financing of unquoted companies ranging from small early stage to large management buy-outs. Others define VC as private, corporate or public funds that focus on investments in early stage technology based companies. VC is described as the ""business of building business."" VC has a particular emphasis on entrepreneurial undertakings and less mature business. It is classified into four types; Seed stage, startup stage, expansion stage and replacement capital.

Private Equity (PE) is the use of equity capital for entities not publicly traded. It can be used to develop new products and technologies, expand working capital, make acquisitions or strengthen a company's balance sheet. It can also resolve ownership and management issues- a succession in family-owned companies, or buy-in or buy-out of a business by experienced managers. PE investment is typically a transformational, value added and active investment strategy.

GVCA will cover several aspects of the VC/PE industry such as trends and strategies, legal/fiscal policies and regulations, investment models, management of fund raising and structures, technology evaluation and valuation, contracts and control rights, information/studies, early-stage funding and corporate venture capital, among others.
