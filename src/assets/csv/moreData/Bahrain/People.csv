He started his career teaching Statistics & Quantative Business Analytics at the University of San Francisco, California, as a TA during his Undergrad studies where he double majored in Accounting & Business Management.

In the Summer of 2012, Mohammed moved back from San Francisco-CA to The Kingdom of Bahrain, and spent the rest of the year doing volunteer work for the United Nations Industrial Development Program (UNIDO) as a Business Counselor; teaching new entrepreneurs business strategy, financial modeling, marketing & resource planning.

Come 2013, Mohammed moved to EAG Group as a Business Development Officer, a Multi-National Group of Companies with investments in Real Estate, Construction, Steel Manufacturing, Security Systems, Commodity Trade and other sectors. He spent time learning and refining each subsidiary in the group, as well as developing new projects and partnerships, especially in ICT.

In late 2013, Mohammed received a seed investment from EAG to build & manage a new Tech Holding Company, Nayzaq Technologies Co. to develop a global partnership network of Tech Companies interested in doing business in the Middle East. Projects accomplished included clients such as Bahrain Airport Services (BAS), Regional Banks and Int�l Hotel Chains.

https://www.crunchbase.com/person/al-saj-rashid,Al Saj Rashid,�,Bahrain,Asia,"865,654",Al Saj,Rashid,Male,"Football is still one of Bahrain's most popular and well-liked sports. In all respects, there aren't many players on the national football circuit who have recently proved their skills with such a remarkable exhibition and variety of skills. Al Saj Rashid, a talented and bright midfielder who will play his first game for the Al Asad football team next season, has developed into one of these young and promising players.

Saj Rashid, who was born and brought up in Isa town, did not have a childhood filled with wonderful memories and experiences. His father used to work as an agent for a nearby multinational corporation, and the family struggled to make ends meet on his wages.

As a result, his mother was forced to work in a local beauty salon. As a child, Al Saj Rashid had a strong passion for football, and he never missed an opportunity to play a game with the kids in his area.

He eventually found a spot in the school's foot-ball team while finishing his primary schooling at a local primary school, owing to his outstanding qualities and talent. Fortunately, he was noticed playing by a member of the Al Asad football club, who was looking for some talented boys to join their junior team.

In light of everything, this is how it all started for little Al Saj Rashid, and in a short period of time, he captured the hearts of many at the Al Asad football club junior football squad.
Al Saj Rashid remains the only player in the Bahrain league's youth division to maintain the top three scoring positions in a single season. Given his age, he has scored 40 goals so far in the league, which is an impressive feat.

Despite the fact that his career as a football player hasn't yet ended, he is undoubtedly being tracked and contacted by numerous Bahrain league franchisees. As a result, we may predict that the day will come when this young player will light up the senior football courts as well.

In terms of his accomplishments, Al Saj Rashid was recently honoured by the Bahrain League with the ""Young Player of the Year"" award for the second year in a row. This, without a doubt, demonstrates how talented and enthusiastic this player is.

According to several sports experts and professionals from the well-known magazine Sports Illustrated, if there is one name in the young players section who will have a significant impact in the Bahrain league due to his outstanding game play and abilities, it has to be none other than Al Saj Rashid.""This man from Bahrain has all of the capability and qualifications to make it into the senior side,"" they said, ""and we should keep preparing for something great and spectacular in the future years.""",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-saj-rashid/

However, when it comes to choosing the top seafood exporter in Bahrain, you can't go wrong with Ebrahim Saj Rashid and his team. Ebrahim Saj Rashid is backed by years of experience and expertise in the same domain. The company is flying high with its ever-growing customer base across various countries around the world.
Ebrahim Saj Rashid finished his MBA from a top business school in Bahrain and joined his father�s business right after that. Even though he came over as the son of the owner of the firm, he started his journey from a lower position in the firm.
Besides the seafood export business, Ebrahim Saj Rashid is heavily interested in sports like football, horse riding and basketball. During his free time, you can always find him trying his hands at any of the aforementioned sports. As of now, Ebrahim Saj Rashid plans to take his business aspirations to some other key parts of the globe.
Ebrahim Saj Rashid received his entrepreneurial traits from his father, who has been involved in the same field for many years. He had an interest in entering his family's company when he was just ten years old.
While he was a great student, his managerial abilities immediately pleased his mentors and instructors. Ebrahim Saj Rashid earned his MBA from a prestigious business school in Bahrain, and after completing it, he teamed up with his father.
He never reaped the benefits of being the son of a successful businessman; instead, he carved out his own niche through hard work and commitment. To begin his career in the seafood export industry, he worked in the sales and marketing department.
Given his outstanding knowledge and talents in the same sector, he was elevated to the management level in the same department after only 5 years. Fortunately, the company achieved significant progress in terms of commercial development and expansion.
In just two years as a sales and marketing manager, Ebrahim Saj Rashid demonstrated his proficiency in the same business. He was later elevated to Business Head in the same company as a result of his significant contribution to the overall firm's growth.
After a successful tenure at the corporation, Ebrahim Saj Rashid decided to start his own seafood export company, Ebrahim Saj Rashid and Co.",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebrahim-saj-rashid-bbb290226/

His leadership sparked the fund�s transformation into a profitable organisation as he oversaw the growth and diversification of its portfolio with strategic acquisitions in Europe and the USA. Today it is recognised as one of the most transparent sovereign wealth funds in the world. Alkooheji holds a BEng in Mechanical Engineering from Staffordshire University and a MBA from Henley College of Management, Brunel University.

His career has spanned the public sector with a focus on industrial and commercial investments. As the Chairman of Alba (Aluminium Bahrain) between 2008 and 2014, he spearheaded the company�s restructuring and the successful listing of 10% of its shares on both the London and Bahrain stock exchanges. Similarly, as the Chairman of Gulf Air between 2007 and 2008, he launched the airline�s single-ownership restructuring programme.

His history within the Ministry of Finance is noteworthy as he administered the privatisation of key public assets in his years as the Director of Government Shareholding, developing the national privatisation policy. This was further enhanced in his continued capacities as Assistant Undersecretary through which he supported the Economic Development Board�s efforts to establish Mumtalakat.

In recognition of his public service to the Kingdom, Alkooheji is the recipient of a number of honours. Most notably, he was awarded the Order of Shaikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, 4th Class in 2000 and the Order of Achievement, 1st Class by HM King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa in 2012. A Chevalier of the L�gion d�honneur, the highest decoration in France, he represents Mumtalakat on the boards of important Bahrain-based companies in addition to the McLaren Group and McLaren Automotive.",,https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahmood-alkooheji-28b406145/

His DJ career started in 1997, but it was 2009 before he released his debut studio album History in the Making, featuring many local and international artists. It was the first Bahraini hip-hop album to be distributed in musical outlets across the country as well as being sold on digital distribution platforms including iTunes and Amazon. His annual mixtape series �The Middle East Invasion� (which is currently on volume six) presents Arab artitsts handpicked by Outlaw so that the world can experience what Arabian hip-hop has to offer.

Outlaw has been producing music since 2003. �Bahrain Unite� and 2011�s �Arab World Unite� were two of his biggest projects so far � the latter, featuring seven artists from around the Arab world, was released on Saudi hip-hop artist Qusai�s album, and both tracks garnered international media attention. In 2014, the hit single �Samboosa� � produced by Outlaw and performed by Kuwaiti Outlaw Productions artist, Daffy � quickly went viral, bagging 100,000 views on YouTube within a week of the video release. In July 2016, 9ARAT, a collaborative album between Outlaw Productions artists Flipperachi and Daffy produced by DJ Outlaw, was released, claiming the Number One spot on the iTunes MENA charts.
