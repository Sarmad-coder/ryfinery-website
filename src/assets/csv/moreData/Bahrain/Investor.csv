He started his career teaching Statistics & Quantative Business Analytics at the University of San Francisco, California, as a TA during his Undergrad studies where he double majored in Accounting & Business Management.

In the Summer of 2012, Mohammed moved back from San Francisco-CA to The Kingdom of Bahrain, and spent the rest of the year doing volunteer work for the United Nations Industrial Development Program (UNIDO) as a Business Counselor; teaching new entrepreneurs business strategy, financial modeling, marketing & resource planning.

Come 2013, Mohammed moved to EAG Group as a Business Development Officer, a Multi-National Group of Companies with investments in Real Estate, Construction, Steel Manufacturing, Security Systems, Commodity Trade and other sectors. He spent time learning and refining each subsidiary in the group, as well as developing new projects and partnerships, especially in ICT.

In late 2013, Mohammed received a seed investment from EAG to build & manage a new Tech Holding Company, Nayzaq Technologies Co. to develop a global partnership network of Tech Companies interested in doing business in the Middle East. Projects accomplished included clients such as Bahrain Airport Services (BAS), Regional Banks and Int�l Hotel Chains. Nayzaq gradually moved from building partnerships/agencies to developing their own in-house SAAS Technologies.

In 2016 he was promoted to become President of EAG and develop their International Business Operations, managing International Investments & Finance Projects in Infrastructure, Energy and Real Estate.

Late 2018, Mohammed decided to step out of his Executive position in EAG to develop a new globally disruptive venture in the Tech space.

After months of R&D the vision was completely conceptualized and in early 2019 Mohammed finally founded �Qongfu: The Fitness Social Network & Marketplace�.

The company ran a stealth operation for months, meeting clients, partaking in Sports Events, refining the POC and implementing Prototype Testing.

On Oct 1st 2020 Qongfu announced its Beta release to the Bahrain App Store.

Stay tuned for further announcements on Qongfu releases and disruptive-packed action!",Male,�,1,�,�,�,�,"123,013",�,�
