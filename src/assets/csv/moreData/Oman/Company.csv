Our platform is based on two main drivers, artificial intelligence and gamification.
AI engines personalize contents and all of its different variables to make a unique learning path for each individual user. For instance, we might customize the interface, change playback speed, substitute the contents, and choose different interactive questions based on their behavior with the aim of saving time and inventing a wonderful experience.
On the other hand, a gamification system would build an intrinsic motivation depending on the learner's player type in order to enjoy their way of mastery. For example, we use different game elements like leaderboard, special badges, streak days, and point system in non-game contexts like education.
The combination of these drivers can create a delightful learning atmosphere.
