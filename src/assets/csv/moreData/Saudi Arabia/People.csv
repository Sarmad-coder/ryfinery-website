In 2010 Al Sawwaf established White Global Investments, which has its head office in London.

These include the launching of the city�s first fully fledged Family Medical Care Center and Polyclinic, satellite urgent care clinics, the Medical District in partnership with the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH), KAEC�s first private university starting with the College of Business Administration & Entrepreneurship in affiliation with Babson Global, the expansion of The World Academy (TWA) the city�s first K-12 International school powered by GEMS Education, 6 Vocational and Technical Education Colleges in collaboration with the Saudi government to name a few.

This effort resulted in the awarding of Phase I of KAEC�s city-wide ICT infrastructure through a SAR600 million Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) concession, reducing EEC�s capital outlay and allowing the provisioning of ICT services to end-users at the highest quality and competitive cost.

Prior to joining EEC Mazen held key positions in a number of reputable organizations including the National Commercial Bank (NCB), the largest bank in KSA and the Middle East by assets, and the global energy giant Saudi Aramco Oil Company.

At a young age, inspired by great scientists and thinkers, Hayat convinced her family to allow her to travel alone to England to pursue her higher education, a rare permission for a young Saudi woman. She went on to earn a degree in pharmacology with honors from King�s College London in 1995 and five years later became the first woman from the Gulf to obtain a PhD in biotechnology from Cambridge. Driven by her desire to more closely link science and social impact she co-founded a non-profit organization with a team at Harvard called Diagnostics For All which creates innovative, inexpensive, point-of-care diagnostic devices for people in impoverished regions. These devices require no power, water or trained doctors and have the ability to provide potentially life-saving medical results in minutes. She has invented a machine combining the effects of light and ultra-sound for use in biotechnology. Along with her scientific activities, she participated in numerous events aimed at raising the awareness of science amongst women, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the Muslim World. She is also interested in the problem of brain drain.Further, at the heart of Sindi�s innovations was a passion to develop an entrepreneurial ecosystem in the Middle East that would transcend existing gaps between education and opportunity. In 2011 she launched i2, the Institute for imagination and Ingenuity, to encourage innovation among young people specifically male and female scientists, technologists and engineers.",i2 Institute for imagination and ingenuity,https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayat-sindi-63639080/

With industry surveys suggesting a staggering 80% of AI and Data Science initiatives fail to deliver value, we explore approaches - developed over the past 20 years - for increasing the chances of success. We will start with the key risk factors, including: Did it start with ""why"" - and what is the approach to understanding value? Is it safe to fail - and conducive for learning? Have we dared to think - and step - outside the box? The conversation will then shift focus towards strategies for overcoming these challenges (centred around 3 core initiatives) and then - controversially - considers if we could spin the disadvantages of data silos into actively encouraged strategies.

In his current capacity, Hani manages the legal affairs of the EEC Group.

In addition, Hani chairs and manages several committees within the Group including the Contracts Awards Committee, Safety & Security Committee, and the Crises Management Committee.

In 2008 EEC recruited Hani as the General Counsel & Secretary of the Board, where he solidified the company�s legal department. He also provided legal advice and executive secretarial services to the Board of Directors and the various committees under its management. He drafted the company�s corporate governance manual in coordination with the Board. In addition, he participated in drafting laws and regulations for the local economic cities.

Prior to EEC, Hani started his career with Saudi Aramco in 1993 as a trainee and progressed towards becoming a process engineer in Ras Tanura Refinery in 1999, with a degree in chemical engineering from Oregon State University. After a couple of years as a practicing engineer, Saudi Aramco selected him for a scholarship to attend law school at Lewis & Clark Northwestern School of Law in Portland, Oregon. Soon after obtaining his Juris Doctorate in 2004, he joined the law firm of Bracewell & Giuliani LLP in Houston, Texas as a visiting attorney focusing on labor cases and policies. In 2005, Hani returned to Saudi Aramco�s offices in Dhahran as legal counsel working on various corporate and employment matters.

Moreover, in late 2006, Saudi Aramco assigned him the position of interim chief legal counsel at KAUST to establish the first legal department for the university and participate in drafting its constitutional documents, such as its charter and bylaws, and obtaining the necessary approvals from the highest authorities in the Kingdom.

https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aiyah-saihati,Aiyah Saihati,�,Saudi Arabia,,"653,798",Aiyah,Saihati,Female,"Aiyah Saihati is an advocate for women�s rights and economic empowerment, an international entrepreneur and an intellectual. Her educational background involves studying engineering, design and business, and she is also highly involved in the non-profit sector and a design career to boot. She began studying in her home country of Saudi Arabia, but continued her education in both Europe and the U.S. Saihati is truly a student of the world. She is a citizen of both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, currently residing in Washington D.C. While still service as her privately owned company's president, she is also busy with a wide variety of other activities.

Aiyah Saihati is dedicated to the defense and empowerment of women, especially in her home country Saudi Arabia. For example, she wrote an open letter to the Saudi government following an incident in which a woman was raped and then punished for her actions despite being the victim. This stunning letter was circulated throughout the international media, translated into more than ten languages. As a self-defined moderate Muslim, Saihati based her arguments on her extensive research and knowledge of both judicial precedents in international law, as well as Shari�a Islamic law. She wrote that although the Qur�an advises against a woman from meeting a man privately, it does not prescribe a punishment; the Saudi government sentenced the victim first to 90 lashes and then, following an appeal, increased it to half a year in prison and 200 lashes. Fortunately, due to the outcry, the sentence of the victim was dropped. Saihati calls on Saudis to unite in the defense of women in her home nation to repair systemic flaws that lead to a woman being punished for a crime that was carried out against her, rather than by her.

Aiyah Saihati is involved in other regional projects to help advance the status of women in the Arab world. She has spoken out about the Arab Spring of the last year, and the potential it opens for the betterment of women�s lives. She is a frequent lecturer at various universities subjects pertaining to entrepreneurship and leadership, as well as the Middle East. For example, she was invited to give a lecture at the Wharton Business School MENA conference. She espoused the changes that have occurred already, with some Saudi women, such as herself, being able to progress in the business world and even hold executive roles in major international and local business enterprises. Saihati was also asked to participate in a U.S. Congress discussion on U.S.-Saudi relations, which she can shed a particular light on due to her own status as sitting on this cultural fence.

Another twist in Aiyah Saihati�s engaging and fascinating career is her early project as a designer. Her interest began while in university when she worked in an art gallery where she began to learn about and appreciate modern art and some of its �classic� stars, such as Picasso and Renoir. She took an interest in design and embarked on a path of learning about functional design. Saihati�s first design outlet were her shoe collections, which are renowned for being feminine and elegant, yet making a statement.",,http://www.linkedin.com/pub/aiyah-saihati/2/212/843
