Eventually, the total demand for pharmaceutical products has reached the highest levels in some MENA countries, and the pharmaceutical products sales are expected to grow massively in the upcoming years.

Some of the biggest European and American pharmaceutical companies have ongoing projects, establishing new pharmaceutical plants in the MENA region, including Saudi Arabia which is expected to be the leading pharma manufacturing hub in the region.
That�s why the MENA Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Congress sets a unique platform by gathering the pioneers from the local and international pharmaceutical companies - CEOs, plant managers, production managers, supply chain managers, quality assurance managers, regulators affairs managers, and engineers - in addition to the leading technology providers who demonstrates the latest technologies and developments in pharmaceutical manufacturing in Saudi Arabia, the biggest pharmaceutical market in the region. The congress includes case studies, presentations, and interactive panel discussions which focus on issues like the obstacles facing the pharmaceutical industry, the integration between the different concerned entities, and the future of the industry in the region. The conference is accompanied by an exhibition that features the latest machineries and technologies used during the different pharmaceutical manufacturing stages, raw materials suppliers, and the regional manufacturers in the country.
