The ABC (acronym for Asset Backed Crypto) Summit will serve as a business show for several start ups from the most diverse areas which have in common the fact that their activities are supported by assets (gold, silver, lithium,�) or added value projects.

Using this criteria, the organisation was able to scrutinise the type of companies and their business model if seeking crowdfunding through the issuance and sale of own cryptocurrencies - Initial Coin Offer (ICO).

Such pre-selection will certainly help investors to look with greater confidence at projects presented at the event, specially at a time when market volatility leads to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin - originated in the Blockchain and based on speculation - undergoing extreme price swings.

Among the prominent public speakers who have confirmed their presence are Kevin O'Leary - ""Mr. Wonderful"" from the hugely successful US TV program ��Shark Tank��, Dragan Primorac, an internationally renowned and awarded physician and many others (Kenny Au, Eric Gu, David Teruzzi, Vladimir Nikitin,�).

Blockchain has the potential to become the next mainstream infrastructure for communication and commerce, for instance, and can introduce new freedoms while streamlining compliance and universal interoperability.

The ABC Summit will be held at the Estoril Casino's (Lisbon) �Sal�o Preto e Prata�, from May 16 to 17, 2018.

While technology offers several opportunities and advantages, it also represents its fair share of security concerns and threats. Emerging channels, such as mobile banking, digital banking platforms, Internet of Things (IoT) etc., are being exploited by cyber criminals. Over the past few years, the BFSI industry in the Middle East has become one of the prime targets for highly sophisticated and targeted attacks.

Digitisation is expected to increase the annual cost of cybercrime to US$ 6 trillion by 2021. In light of the recent ransomware attacks, global spending on security products and services is projected to exceed US$ 1 trillion over the next five years. Although banks are increasing their spending to protect customers and data, security is no longer a one-size-fits-all solution. Security professionals must be equipped with adequate intelligence to stay ahead of ever-evolving technology and changing user behavior.

The second edition of Finsec�The Banking Security Summit will bring together leading decision makers and solution providers to share case studies and address key challenges.

Poor healthcare access, late presentation and a change in lifestyles have meant that cancer incidence is due to rise faster than any region in the world by 2030, to almost double what it was in 2012. Yet poor data on cancer incidence, mortality and patient satisfaction, makes meeting the challenge all the more difficult. For patients, overcoming the fatalism and stigma surrounding cancer is an additional barrier to treatment.

In 2015, The Economist Events declared war on cancer at an inaugural summit in London. Since then, we have taken the conversation from Boston to Hong Kong, Singapore to Oslo, to explore the most pressing issues in policy and financing, treatment and care across the globe. Bringing together a diverse audience from the policy, finance, and medical communities, our aim has been to share best practice and to catalyse action; breaking down silos to confront the enormous challenge cancer presents.

War on Cancer Middle East 2018 aims to explore the state of cancer care in the region, sharing and comparing different approaches as well as exchanging insights from the region and the rest of the world. Through robust panel debates, case studies, and strategy sessions, we will explore the evolving policy solutions to the increase in cancer incidence, as well as the innovative financing models that can bridge the funding gap for treatment. Our case studies will tackle some of the issues surrounding fatalism and stigma, while also crucially ensuring that the patients themselves are front and centre of the discussion. We will bring together leaders from government, healthcare, academia and industry to assess how the Middle East can manage its cancer burden.

Highlights:

* Cancer control in the Middle East

* The patient�s perspective

* Putting vision to work

* Early detection and screening

* Treatment and palliation

* Financing the gap

* Innovation in health systems

Biochemistry is the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes at the cellular and molecular level. Biochemistry is both a life science and a chemical science - it explores the chemistry of living organisms and the molecular basis for the changes occurring in living cells. It uses the methods of chemistry, physics, molecular biology and immunology to study the structure and behavior of the complex molecules found in biological material and the ways these molecules interact to form cells, tissues and whole organisms. Biochemistry has become the foundation for understanding all biological processes. It underlies and includes such exciting new fields as molecular genetics and bioengineering. Biochemistry is also unique in providing teaching and research in both protein structure/function and genetic engineering.

Biochemistry also includes many subspecialties such as neurochemistry, bioorganic chemistry, clinical biochemistry, physical biochemistry, molecular genetics, biochemical pharmacology and immunochemistry. Recent advances in these areas have created links among technology, chemical engineering and biochemistry.

Why to attend?
Biochemistry 2019 mainly focuses on the universities, institutes, research centers and major societies along with companies which hold a big market in laboratory technologies. Target audience involves students, faculties, researchers, scientists, dean, directors and CEO's of the companies.

SteelFab is the region�s best trade platform that consistently brings cutting-edge technology from across the world on a single platform.


For over a decade, the region�s steel fabrication and metal working industry has relied solely on SteelFab to acquire latest machinery and equipment to improve productivity and efficiency.


This has resulted in SteelFab growing from strength to strength, registering impressive growth in number of exhibitors, brands on display, visitors, business leads and enquiries that translate into actual sales.


Now, with the country and the region providing a fresh momentum to economic diversification the steel fabrication industry is looking at better growth momentum, providing a great opportunity for machinery and equipment makers and dealers.


STEELFAB � RIDING ON CORE SECTOR GROWTH


The majority of the demand will be generated by the region�s core sector, which includes construction, manufacturing, oil and gas and infrastructure, besides the pipeline industry.


SITTING PRETTY ON STRONG FUNDAMENTALS


The steel fabrication and metal working industry is bracing for a deluge of opportunities, given that the economy has entered the growth cycle and the core sector is in expansion mode.


The much acclaimed World Expo 2020 win and the reclassification of the UAE to emerging market status are sure to add dynamism to the economy that is spurred by a resurgent construction sector, huge non-oil sector investments, high oil prices, and the booming industrial and manufacturing industry, among others.


Demand from these core sectors have been consistent for the past couple of years and are projected to increase sharply in the future, prompting the steel fabrication sector to look at acquiring new machinery and technology to enhance production.

Protecting the environment is a global priority and it is as urgent in the Middle East and North Africa region as it is anywhere else in the world. While short-term thinking has often meant that economic growth has taken place to the detriment of the natural environment, there is a rising call for a change in mindset, advancing the notion that the economy and the environment go hand in hand.


This event will convene business leaders, policymakers, scientists, academics, and investors, to offer them concrete strategies and ideas to help them to prepare for the future, and scale up their efforts towards ensuring sustainability. How can regional policymakers apply lessons learnt across the globe to their country�s sustainability plans? What must business leaders do to scale up action from responsibility to leadership? What role does the financial industry have to play in encouraging green investment? What research is needed to stimulate eco-innovation, and how can scientific evidence and models facilitate better decision making? We will be discussing these topics and many more during the forum.

The road to price recovery has been slow and remains uncertain due to major geopolitical and macroeconomic changes, environmental considerations, and the signs of a potential 'Fracking 2.0' era. This workshop will focus on discussing these driving forces and their impact on economic returns versus growth strategies in the current environment.

?The workshop topics are focused on the latest economic valuation best practices, risk assessment techniques, asset life cycle optimisation tools, cost reduction methods, portfolio management ideas, and the value of quantifying uncertainty as well as global economic trends and investor focus areas. Although the majority of the focus is on the upstream industry, with its cost and price challenges, many of the topics take into account the need for an integrated upstream and downstream investment evaluation. Delegates will also have the opportunity to understand the impact of recent innovations on unconventional resources economics."

The main pillars to achieve these objectives are people, performance, profitability and efficiency. Hence, assets that are utilised to extract and process hydrocarbons need to be integral and reliable.

To achieve the optimum management of assets, an organisation�s asset integrity management system (AIMS) should consider all the main pillars, by developing and implementing robust processes, procedures and guidelines for maintenance and inspection activities.

AIMS needs to be supported by a competency program for people who are implementing integrity critical tasks, a knowledge management program for smooth experience transition between generations, and retention of organisation memory.

In this edition of the asset integrity management workshop, we are going to address innovative and best practices adapted by asset owners to maintain, or even exceed, their competitive advantages in the current challenging market conditions, with support from advanced technical solutions provided by the business partners."
