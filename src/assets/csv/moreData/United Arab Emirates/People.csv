He is environmentally conscious and foresees a major shift in the near future toward green energy. To that end, he has business interests in electric mobility and household waste management.

Initially immersed in property development while living in Australia, Coffen gravitated toward data/ cyber security upon moving to the UAE, a move he considered a natural progression. He sees how the world is evolving and how a company�s digital needs are crucial for every business leader.

A keen businessman, Luke was involved in the Chinese real estate sector prior to founding Student.com. Before moving to Asia, where he has lived for over 10 years, he had first-hand experience of being an international student, both in London where he received a bachelor�s degree in Banking and International Finance from Cass Business School and in Milan, where he received a Master�s in International Economics and Management from SDA Bocconi.

He competed his schooling from Breeks All India High School, Ooty. Moreover, he holds an undergraduate degree in Business from MES College, Bangalore.

The idea of Fleurs germinated in 2005; a floriculture export business, which was primal at the onset. The company thereby exported flowers from India to Malaysia, Thailand, and other South Asian countries. It was no sooner that Fleurs began exporting flowers to different South East Asian countries. Notably, Fleurs became the first company to export fresh-cut Jasmine from India to New York. A unique process was initiated for the process. This led the company to copyright the Jasmine Flower Process in India, which was the company�s novel idea.

Being an entrepreneur is the way forward � was the primal belief that drove Mr. Prashanth Balaji to step into the business world, and thereafter, there was no looking back.

From floriculture, to mining, to event management; the past decade had been an adventurous journey for this business magnate, extending into the various spheres of business in the world market, and the journey goes on�

With extensive hard work, focus and determination, Prashanth stepped into the mining industry in 2007. The business took off to great heights, racing ahead in a world of competition. Being a visionary that he is, the mining business multiplied and diversified from local markets, to gaining reputation in Dubai, Sydney, Kaiserslautern and Sao Paulo. His core strengths range from being problem-solving to maintaining excellent rapport with clients and colleagues led him to reach greater heights. Furthermore, his network and contacts steered to extend the business to farer ends � China, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Direct employment, seasonal employment and contracted farmers sustain 15,000 people. In services, MTC has stimulated the region�s economy in a number of ways. A good example is the transport sector. MTC operations require over 2,500 trucks annually to transport raw materials as well as finished products. These activities have a spin-off effects on fuel consumption, accommodation and associated general services.

Apart from his job obligations, he has had a strong interest in horse riding since childhood and has gone on to represent his country at an international level during his teenage days.

Up the basis of his own commercial acumen and knowledge, he has also taken on the majority of the developmental efforts on his own. He and his buddies have become involved in a lot of humanitarian activities across the country, and it's not all about business for them.

Sheikh Saj Rashid was born in Dubai on April 26, 1978, into a business family. Following some early academic success, he decided to pursue horse riding as a hobby. As he grew up, Sheikh Saj Rashid intended to achieve something great in the corporate sector in addition to his love in the sport.

By 1999, he realised that in order to gain all of the necessary business expertise and experience, he needed to bring in some foreign experience. In a similar vein, he chose to relocate his family from the United Arab Emirates to the United Kingdom, where he discovered all potential avenues and connections to expand his business and aptitude in the petroleum industry.

He had founded his own company, Rashid petrochemicals ltd, in 2008, after relocating to the UK. Sheikh Saj Rashid joined the company as Chairman and Managing Director and immediately completed a deal that included a merger with one of the most well-known petrochemicals companies in the world.
By 2015, Mr. Sheikh Saj Rashid had established a significant name and reputation in the petrochemicals industry, as well as receiving a number of major accolades and honours in the process.
Mr. Sheikh Saj Rashid became a British citizen in 2019, yet he continued to visit Dubai on a regular basis to see through his business. He returned to Dubai in 2020 to expand his firm in both financial and development terms.

Mr. Sheikh Saj Rashid has recently established himself as one of Dubai's most influential entrepreneurs, and while now acting as the CEO of Rashid Petrochemicals Ltd, he has led the company to new heights with his tireless efforts and dedication.

He has also taken on the majority of the developmental initiatives alone on the basis of his own business acumen and knowledge. Still, it's not all about business for him, and he and his buddies have become active in a number of humanitarian efforts across the country.

Mr. Sheikh Saj Rashid has done his MBA in finance from University of Dubai. While his initial interest towards Horse riding sometime conflicts his business interests, he learned to manage both the aspirations with utmost ease eventually.

As of now, he loves to play and watch some other sports like Cricket and Football and dreams of owing a football team in the near future. He also loves travelling to different countries and planning to extend his business outreach to different regions across the globe.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheikh-saj-rashid/,https://twitter.com/SajShiekh

He is seen as the driving force behind the UAE's interventionist foreign policy and is a leader of a campaign against Islamist movements in the Arab World.[2][3] In January 2014 Khalifa, the emir of Abu Dhabi, suffered a stroke but was in a stable condition. He has since assumed a lower profile in state affairs, but retained presidential powers. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan now carries out public affairs of the state. Mohammed bin Zayed was entrusted with most day-to-day decision making of the emirate of Abu Dhabi as the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and most of the presidential public affairs of the state and hence, he is sometimes considered as the UAE's de facto ruler.[4] In 2019 the New York Times named him as the most powerful Arab ruler and one of the most powerful men on Earth.[5][6] He was also named as one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2019 by TIME magazine.[7]

https://www.crunchbase.com/person/samer-khouzami,Samer Khouzami,�,,United Arab Emirates,,"76,280",Samer,Khouzami,Male,"Growing up in a tight-knit, modest and conservative Lebanese village,
Samer Khouzami started his career working as an errands-boy of sorts at a
local hair & beauty salon as a means to financially support himself
throughout his college studies. Shortly after, his curiosity led him to
experiment with makeup and technique, and he was promoted to an MUA,
gaining recognition among the salon�s clients. With his newly discovered
talent, Samer made the decision to put a halt to his studies and focus on
harnessing his skills, which would in turn lead him to buying out the hair &
beauty salon shareholders, making him the sole owner of what was to
become Maison Samer Khouzami.

Samer�s limitless ambition asked him to shoot for the moon, and with his
hunger to pursue his passion, he ventured into a unique business
endeavor, launching a series of global workshop tours in 2014. With his
work sought after by celebrities and a wide base of global clientele; he
would soon fill the halls with 200+ eager audiences, teaching his
unparalleled contour and highlighting techniques across the world,
landing in L.A. to collaborate with the likes of Anastasia Soare.
With no intention of slowing down, Samer went full steam ahead with his
success story and set forth to make sure he made a permanent mark on
the beauty world. And so in 2017, Samer Khouzami Cosmetics was born.
The brand launched with four core products and an inclusivity clause, one
that reflected who Samer truly was: a non-gender conforming, openly gay
Middle Eastern man. The Brand was quickly picked up by Sephora Middle
East to be the first Lebanese/Arab brand to ever be retailed.
Becoming a brand of his own, one main aspect was placed under a
magnifying glass: his identity. Being a high-profile gay man that leads by
example in advocacy for gender fluidity and LGBTQ+ communities in the
Middle East has its fair share of struggle. In 2020, Samer made the
personal decision to break free from the �straight image� that his
conformist society expected of him, and gave his 2M+ followers on
instagram a glimpse of his true self; a move that was received with heavy
criticism, hate speech and discrimination.
Regardless of mass opinion, Samer continues to live the life he�s
envisioned for himself as a successful, openly gay Arab CEO. Gaining
popularity amongst the underground LGBTQ+ community helped Samer
realize that he was looked at as an influential entity, carrying the torch for
better days to come. He, to many as well as himself, personifies the
gender fluid, non-binary and queer communities and has fanned the fire
of fighting for the day where sexual preference and identity are not illegal,
but a basic human right.
It has now become Samer�s mission to be the example and voice that says
to individuals within the region�s hidden LGBTQ+ and non-binary
communities, that they shouldn�t be hidden, but celebrated. That the
world is open to them, and they can have it all, without ever having to
leave their homes in the Middle East in search of acceptance and life
elsewhere.",https://lb.linkedin.com/in/samer-khouzami-b216931a3,https://twitter.com/samer_khouzami?lang=en

In 1999 Soeren and Christian partnered up with another local provider and focused Help AG�s business solely on Security for the Internet access � firewall installation and network security concepts.

From 1995 up until 2001, Soeren assumed the role of technical consultant for Help AG and also worked as a trainer for several firewall vendors. With the company�s success in wining several significant German customers in 2001, he focused purely on the professional organizational development of the company.

In 2007 Soeren took a chance to bring Help AG business to a new level by transferring the shares to one of the world�s largest technical service organizations � T�V Rheinland. In the following 3 years he merged T�V�s service portfolio of assessment services and Help AG�s implementation and operations services. This merging process resulted in establishing a new corporate brand in the market � T�V Rheinland i-sec GmbH with over 100 consultants and turnover of more than $30 million.

In 2011, after finding and recruiting his successor for T�V Rheinland i-sec GmbH, Soeren moved to Help AG�s Middle East office as a Chief Operating Officer to use his organizational experience to secure the company�s growth and foster expansion into more territories across the Middle East.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/s%C3%B6ren-kroh-0933a5a0,
