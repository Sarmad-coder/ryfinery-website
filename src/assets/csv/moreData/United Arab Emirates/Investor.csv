ADNOC is committed to sustainable development.  In 2009, the company has launched the �ADNOC Sustainability Performance Initiative� ensuring a harmonious balance between society�s needs and Earth�s resources, while its track record in HSE sets the standards for the rest of the Arabian Gulf.

Giving top priority to education, ADNOC established a number of institutions that train and develop a qualified UAE cadre for the energy sector.

DEWA was formed in 1992 following the merger of the Dubai Electricity Company and the Dubai Water Department which had been operational independently since 1959. DEWA�s 9,700 employees do their best to manage the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and water across the emirate.

Customers
DEWA serves a large customer base across the emirate. DEWA provides 652,200 customers with electricity and 580,678 customers with water (2013 figures).

Core Objectives:

As part of the Government of Dubai, DEWA�s core objectives are:
- To establish, manage, operate, and maintain electricity generation and water desalination plants and power and water transmission and distribution networks in Dubai.
- To develop and maintain water resources and supply drinking water.
- To support the vision of Dubai Government to promote sustainable development by driving energy and water use efficiency and investing in alternative energy sources.

Performance:

DEWA�s electricity generation capacity as of 2013 was 9,656MW. Its water production was 470 million imperial gallons per day.DEWA has achieved very competitive results in terms of efficiency and reliability compared to international utilities. This is demonstrated as follows:
- Customer Minutes Lost per year in 2013 was only 5.62 minutes compared to the global standard of 16.4 minutes
- Network Line Losses in 2013 was 3.46% compared to 6-7% in Europe & the US

Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030:

DEWA is committed to achieving the strategic objectives of the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030, formulated by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, to diversify energy resources and improve efficiency of electricity and water usage. To this end, DEWA aims to generate 71% of its total power output from natural gas, 12% from nuclear power, 12% from clean coal and 5% from renewable energy by 2030. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is already generating 13MW through its first phase. The second phase with a capacity of 100MW is underway. Drawing on public-private partnerships, DEWA is developing the Hassyan 1 Clean Coal project. The first phase of the project will have a production capacity of 1,200 MW and is expected to be commissioned by 2020. DEWA also seeks to reduce the demand for water and energy by 30% by 2030.

Smart Dubai Initiatives:

As part of the Smart Dubai Initiative aimed at transforming Dubai into the smartest city in the world in three years through various smart initiatives and services, DEWA has launched three path- breaking programs to drive sustainable development in the emirate.
- The First Initiative: Connecting solar energy to houses and buildings by encouraging households and building owners to install photovoltaic solar panels to generate electricity. The PV solar system will be connected to DEWA�s grid. Electricity produced will be consumed within the premises and the surplus will be exported to the network. This encourages the use of renewable energy and increases its share in the energy mix in line with the Green Economy for Sustainable Development initiative and the National Agenda announced by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.
- The Second Initiative: Smart Applications & your Home- Through Smart Meters and Grids, DEWA will provide various benefits and new applications to its customers, including automatic and detailed readings (both current and historical). The data obtained through these readings will be available to customers to monitor actual consumption for a specific period of time to better understand and manage bills. Additionally, such data will enable comparisons to be made with average norms. These smart meters will support renewable sources of energy in residential, commercial and industrial sectors by comparing energy supplies from consumption and generation sides.
- The Third Initiative: Infrastructure and Electrical vehicles charging stations - This project includes establishing charging stations for electric vehicles in various areas of Dubai and to enhance grid efficiency. DEWA is installing and managing both the infrastructure and the operation of electric vehicles. DEWA supports the introduction of electric vehicles in order to decrease air pollution and protect the environment against the impact caused by transport sectors in the emirate. DEWA�s endeavours include establishing the required infrastructure in collaboration with several stakeholders including car manufacturers, airports, Dubai Municipality, shopping malls, petrol stations, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), hotels, car parks, etc.

International Awards:

DEWA�s commitment to world-class standards has enabled it to achieve various international accolades such as the Sword of Honour for Health and Safety and the Globe of Honour for Environment.

Prior to this position, Noor was a Managing Partner at Leap Ventures, a growth-stage venture capital firm based out of Dubai and Beirut. With experience as a biotechnology and pharmaceutical strategy consultant in the US, and moving back to the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) region in 2005, Noor joined her family business, Depa. Implementing best-practice corporate governance and enabling the scaling of the business tenfold in three years, Noor then led the IPO for the company in 2008 on the NASDAQ Dubai and the London Stock Exchange. In her eight year tenure at Depa, Noor�s involvement ranged from the strategic and growth planning and implementation, to application of corporate governance, the execution of a private placement and an IPO, cross-border acquisitions, regulatory compliance, and investor relations.

During this time, Noor also founded ZenYoga, the first yoga and pilates studio in MENA. ZenYoga grew to become the largest chain of wellness studios in the Middle East, providing space and instruction for over a thousand students to practice yoga weekly, as well as facilities providing international teacher training and qualification leading to improved health and wellness in the region. Noor exited ZenYoga in early 2014 through sale to a private equity firm.

These combined experiences have led Noor to focus in spaces of corporate governance and entrepreneurship.

OnTime is expanding its stores throughout the UAE and has plans to operate Middle East-wide, and beyond.

A goal-oriented and extremely focused person who believes in smart work, and when smart work fails, I do the necessary hard work. A natural team worker and my ability to motivate my teammates has helped us deliver and succeed.

I have gained the conceptual ability to rapidly develop competent knowledge on diverse and complex concepts from different sectors and turn them into compelling business cases and industry conferences by identifying knowledge gaps and understanding the challenges driving that market. I have a keen eye for detail and have developed exceptional communication and networking skills.

I am currently working with Great Minds Group. I have worked on Energy, Utilities, Defense, Oil and Gas projects, Smart Cities, Education, Security, Construction, Entertainment, etc. I always have a realistic approach to each of my projects.

I have been successful in
 -Launching conferences
 -Launching awards program
 -Mentoring sales team
 -Creating Key accounts for the company
 -Training and breeding top sellers and producers

I have also been supporting the digital business of Great Minds Group.

A born fitness freak who believes in mental fitness as well. An adventurous person and I constantly involve myself in one of these: trekking, hiking, kayaking, white water rafting, paragliding, forest safaris, and biking to mention a few.

I provide career advice to young professionals. Being a budding investor (in the Indian, UAE, and US markets), I share financial advice and strategies with people who are looking for alternate revenue streams. I am also providing advice and support to start-ups in B2B space and climate change. I support several environmental and climate change initiatives including Cauvery Calling.

I constantly take time to spend with my daughter and wife, who loves exploring cuisines, countries, and activities.

I possess very diverse knowledge and experience.
